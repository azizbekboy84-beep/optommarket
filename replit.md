# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client-side application is built with **React 18** using TypeScript and follows a component-based architecture. Key architectural decisions include:

- **State Management**: Uses TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management, providing automatic caching, background refetching, and optimistic updates
- **Routing**: Implements client-side routing with Wouter, a lightweight alternative to React Router
- **UI Framework**: Built on shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives, providing accessible and customizable components
- **Styling**: Uses Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming, supporting a consistent design system
- **Internationalization**: Custom language provider supporting Uzbek and Russian with localStorage persistence

## Backend Architecture
The server uses **Express.js** with TypeScript in ESM format:

- **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints organized under `/api` prefix with proper error handling and request logging
- **Storage Layer**: Abstract storage interface (IStorage) with in-memory implementation for development, designed to be easily replaceable with database implementations
- **Development Environment**: Vite integration for hot module replacement and development tooling

## Data Storage Solutions
The application uses **PostgreSQL** as the primary database with **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database operations:

- **Schema Design**: Comprehensive schema supporting users, categories, products, orders, order items, blog posts, and chat messages with proper relationships
- **Multilingual Support**: Database schema includes separate fields for Uzbek and Russian content (nameUz, nameRu, etc.)
- **AI Chat Storage**: Chat messages are stored with session tracking for conversation history
- **Migration Management**: Uses Drizzle Kit for schema migrations with configuration pointing to `./migrations` directory

## Authentication and Authorization
While authentication infrastructure is defined in the schema, the current implementation uses a basic role-based system:

- **User Roles**: Supports customer, seller, and admin roles
- **Session Management**: Prepared for PostgreSQL session storage using connect-pg-simple
- **Security**: Framework in place for expanding authentication features

## Key Features
- **Multilingual Support**: Full Uzbek/Russian localization throughout the application
- **Product Management**: Comprehensive product catalog with categories, pricing tiers (retail/wholesale), and inventory tracking
- **Search Functionality**: Product search capabilities across multiple criteria
- **AI Chat Assistant**: Google Gemini-powered chat widget providing real-time customer support in Uzbek language
- **Push Notifications**: Web push notification system with VAPID keys for user engagement
- **SEO & Analytics**: Google Analytics 4 integration with comprehensive SEO monitoring dashboard
- **Admin Analytics**: Real-time analytics dashboard with SEO metrics, Google Analytics data, and Search Console integration
- **Marketing Tracking**: Google Tag Manager (GTM) integration with Facebook Pixel, UTM parameter tracking, and conversion monitoring
- **Digital Marketing**: Complete advertising campaign tracking for Google Ads, Facebook, and Instagram with ROAS monitoring
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive layouts

# External Dependencies

## AI Services
- **Google Gemini API**: Powers the AI chat assistant with natural language processing and contextual responses in Uzbek language

## Database Services
- **Neon Database**: Uses `@neondatabase/serverless` for PostgreSQL hosting, configured via DATABASE_URL environment variable
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations with PostgreSQL dialect

## Development Tools
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool and development server with React plugin
- **ESBuild**: Backend bundling for production deployment
- **Replit Integration**: Development environment optimizations with runtime error handling and cartographer plugin

## UI and Styling
- **Radix UI**: Comprehensive collection of accessible UI primitives for complex components
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework with custom configuration
- **shadcn/ui**: Pre-built component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography

## Utility Libraries
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management and caching
- **React Hook Form**: Form handling with validation support via `@hookform/resolvers`
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation integrated with Drizzle for schema validation
- **date-fns**: Date manipulation and formatting utilities
- **clsx & class-variance-authority**: Conditional CSS class management

## Session and Storage
- **connect-pg-simple**: PostgreSQL session store for Express sessions
- **Drizzle-Zod**: Integration between Drizzle ORM and Zod for validation

The architecture is designed for scalability and maintainability, with clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend, and a flexible storage layer that can accommodate future growth and feature additions.
